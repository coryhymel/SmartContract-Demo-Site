# README

This is an extension of the demo found [here](https://blog.zeppelin.solutions/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-smart-contracts-in-ethereum-848f08001f05).


Some basic setup things that you'll need if tldr; of the article above. 
- testrpc
- truffle
- Solidity editor (I use atom)




## Helpful Steps
The following is a helpful checklist that use when running and debugging smart contracts. The workflow is more dispersed that the usual self contained IDE you're probably used to.  

1. Terminal and run 'testrpc'
2. CD to top level solidity experiments
3. Make sure migration file is point to correct .sol
4. 'truffle compile'
5. 'truffle migrate'
6. 'truffle console'

---- once your up and running loop here and in truffle console

7. Do whatever updates to .sol file
8. Save
9. 'migrate --reset'
10. 'var poe = ProofOfExistence1.at(ProofOfExistence1.address)'  <- get .sol file as object
11. 'poe.address' <- To find it's address
12. copy and replace in index.js
13. get .sol ABI and repplace in index.js
14. save index.js
15. reload web browser
